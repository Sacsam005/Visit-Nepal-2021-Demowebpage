> A sample website based on a true campaign in 2020 about the promo of my home country, Nepal as a Tourism Destination. Hence, slightly modified and named the Visit Nepal tourism year 2020 to “Visit Nepal 2021” (as per my need). This webpage was created using HTML and CSS only. So, for the functionality purpose, I have randomly included the hyperlinks which might take the client to random other web pages. As I was trying to figure out how much I've learned and how this was gonna look, I finally got this, here you go;

[Visit Nepal-2021](https://visitnepal2021demo.netlify.app/)

For any other alterations you might wanna come up with, I'm open to pull it...
